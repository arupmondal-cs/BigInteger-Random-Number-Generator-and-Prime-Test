## Random BigInteger Generator and Prime Test

This [**C#**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) project shows Random **BigInteger** Generator by using the **Bit Length** of the integers and it's also shows the **Primality** test of the Big Random Integer.

In this project I used **[Miller-Rabin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test)** primality test as an extension method on the BigInteger type.
